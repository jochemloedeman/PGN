# Prompt Generation Networks for Input-Space Adaptation of Frozen Vision Transformers

This repository is the official implementation of the BMVC2024 paper [Prompt Generation Networks for Input-Space Adaptation of Frozen Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06466) by Jochem Loedeman, Maarten Stol, Tengda Han and Yuki M Asano.

## Requirements

To install python dependencies, make sure that [poetry](https://pypi.org/project/poetry/) is installed and execute the following in the project root directory:

```setup
poetry install
```
### Data
See [`data/README.md`](data/README.md)

### DINO
Download the full checkpoint for DINO ViT-S/16 from [here](https://github.com/facebookresearch/dino) and insert it as `pgn/pgn_models/dino/dino_deitsmall16_pretrain_full_checkpoint.pth`.

## Training

To train/test with the CLIP backbone, run

```train
poetry run train_clip
poetry run test_clip
```

To train/test with either DINO or supervised ViT, specify the backbone with `--vision_model_type` and run

```train
poetry run train_visionmodel
poetry run test_visionmodel
```

For all available command line arguments, see [`pgn/scripts`](pgn/scripts).

## Pretrained PGNs
Pretrained PGNs are supplied in [`pretrained_pgns/`](pretrained_pgns). To use them in the context of this repository, specify the desired model by setting the `--pgn_path` argument in the test scripts.
